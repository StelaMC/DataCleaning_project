“tidyData” file gives averages of all estimated means and standard deviation variables calculated from measurements of an accelerometer and a gyroscope across all subjects who participated (N=30) and all activities (N=6). 
The file contains 180 row and 68 columns (66 variables with averages of mean and standard deviation variables, variable containing subject codes and variable containing activity description). 
Variable names have been cleaned to expand “t” and “f” from original name into “time” and “freq” (for frequency), and “()” after mean and std in original name have now been omitted.
